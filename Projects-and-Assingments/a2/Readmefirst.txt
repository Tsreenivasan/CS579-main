The submission contains an inefficient Vectorize function which takes 682 seconds to execute, majority of which is spent at vectorizing the 42 possible settings.

The Python Profiler output also has been attached for reference which contains the eecution time info.

Apologies for the in-efficient submission. Activiely working on identifying the erroneous code which is causing the issue.
